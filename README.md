# Front End Wordle Project

I developed a Wordle application utilizing front-end technologies, including React.js, HTML, and SCSS. Motivated by the desire to challenge myself and demonstrate my proficiency in coding languages, I embarked on this project with the goal of creating a fully functional app from scratch. Unlike tutorial-based projects, this endeavor was a testament to my independent problem-solving skills and comprehensive understanding of the game's mechanics, resulting in a unique and original application.

In conjunction with the front-end project, I have also developed a functional database using MongoDB and Mongoose. Although I intend to deploy and host this site in the future, it is currently operational and undergoing refinement.
